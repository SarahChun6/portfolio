Changes made in Homework 5
==========================

I removed the original projects section in the home page and added a projects page link in the home page nav bar. This new page contained the project cards from hw 5. I created static pages for each project card that provided more pictures to showcase my projects. All projects were coded in 2021-2022 and used Java Graphics.
I also added a favicon logo for my website to make it easily identifiable.
